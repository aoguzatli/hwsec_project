Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 4,296 out of  69,120    6%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               4,296
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      4,353 out of  69,120    6%
    Number used as logic:                    4,353 out of  69,120    6%
      Number using O6 output only:           4,349
      Number using O5 and O6:                    4
  Number of route-thrus:                        28
    Number using O5 output only:                28

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,550 out of  17,280    8%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        5,249
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           953 out of   5,249   18%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 896 out of   5,249   17%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       3,400 out of   5,249   64%
    Number of unique control sets:               3
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  69,120    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       397 out of     640   62%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      3 out of      32    9%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        3

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.68

Peak Memory Usage:  4886 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  3 mins 47 secs
