Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 2,696 out of  69,120    3%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               2,696
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      8,757 out of  69,120   12%
    Number used as logic:                    8,757 out of  69,120   12%
      Number using O6 output only:           8,750
      Number using O5 and O6:                    7

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 2,748 out of  17,280   15%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        9,434
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         6,738 out of   9,434   71%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 677 out of   9,434    7%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       2,019 out of   9,434   21%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  69,120    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       396 out of     640   61%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.54

Peak Memory Usage:  4943 MB
