Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 2,695 out of  69,120    3%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               2,695
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      5,135 out of  69,120    7%
    Number used as logic:                    5,135 out of  69,120    7%
      Number using O6 output only:           5,128
      Number using O5 and O6:                    7

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,477 out of  17,280    8%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        5,633
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,938 out of   5,633   52%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 498 out of   5,633    8%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       2,197 out of   5,633   39%
    Number of unique control sets:               3
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               5 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       396 out of     640   61%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.59

Peak Memory Usage:  4886 MB
